This Modern Weather Forecast App features a stunning liquid-glass (frosted glass) UI built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, delivering both visual appeal and functionality. It integrates a Weather API to provide real-time weather updates along with a 5-day forecast, including details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise/sunset times, air quality index, and health recommendations.

The UI is fully responsive, ensuring an optimized experience across desktops, tablets, and mobiles. Using TailwindCSS, the layout adapts seamlessly while maintaining the sleek, glass-like visual style. Interactive features include dynamic background changes based on weather conditions and day/night mode animations (stars, rain, snow effects) for an immersive experience.

On the JavaScript side, the app demonstrates live API data fetching, search with city suggestions, and geolocation-based weather retrieval. It incorporates performance optimizations, debounced input handling, and robust error management with user-friendly modals to ensure smooth operation even under poor network conditions or API failures.

Whether you're learning frontend development or building production-ready interfaces, this project covers UI design, API integration, responsive layouts, and user interaction handlingâ€”all while delivering a polished, animated, and highly functional weather dashboard. Perfect for showcasing modern web development skills.
